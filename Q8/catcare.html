                <h2>Feeding</h2>
                <p>
                    We recommend purchasing high-quality, brand-name kitten or cat food. Your veterinarian
                    will be able to assess your new cat or kitten and determine the best diet. Factors
                    such as age, activity level and health make a difference in what and how much a cat 
                    should eat.
                    <br><br>
                    Cats require taurine, an essential amino acid, for heart and eye health. You will 
                    need to provide fresh, clean water at all times, and wash and refill your cat's water
                    bowls daily. Treats should be no more than 5-10% of the diet.
                    <br><br>
                    Many people feed baby food to a cat or kitten who is refusing food or not feeling well. 
                    Please read labels carefully: If the baby food contains onion or garlic powder, your pet
                    could be poisoned.
                    <br><br>
                    Take your pet to your veterinarian if signs of anorexia, diarrhea, vomiting or
                    lethargy continue for more than two days.

                <h2>Litter Box</h2>
                <p>
                    All indoor cats need a litter box, which should be placed in a quiet,
                    accessible location.
                    <br><br>
                    In a multi-level home, one box per floor is recommended. Avoid moving
                    the box unless absolutely necessary, but if you must do so, move the box
                    just a few inches per day. Keep in mind that cats won't use a messy,
                    smelly litter box, so scoop solid wastes out of the box at least once a day.
                    <br><br>
                    Dump everything, wash with a mild detergent and refill at least once a week;
                    you can do this less frequently if using clumping litter. 
                    <br><br>
                    Don't use ammonia, deodorants or scents, especially lemon, when cleaning the
                    litter box. If your cat will not use a litterbox, please consult with your
                    veterinarian. Sometimes refusal to use a litter box is based on a medical
                    condition that required treatment.

                <h2>Handling</h2>
                <p>
                    To pick up your cat, place one hand behind the front legs and another
                    under the hindquarters. Lift gently. Never pick up a cat by the scruff of
                    the neck or by the front legs
                </p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="bubble">
                <h2>Grooming</h2>
                <p>
                    Most cats stay relatively clean and rarely need a bath, but you should brush or 
                    comb your cat regularly. Frequent brushing helps keep your cat's coat clean, 
                    reduces the amount of shedding and cuts down on the incidence of hairballs.
                </p>

                <h2>Housing</h2>
                <p>
                    Your pet should have her own clean, dry place in your home to sleep and rest.
                    <br><br>
                    Line your cat's bed with a soft, warm blanket or towel. Be sure to wash the
                    bedding often. Please keep your cat indoors. Outdoor cats do not live as long
                    as indoor cats. Outdoor cats are at risk of trauma from cars, or from fights
                    with other cats, raccoons and free-roaming dogs. 
                    <br><br>
                    Coyotes are known to eat cats. Outdoor cats are more likely to become infested
                    with fleas or ticks, as well as contract infectious diseases.
