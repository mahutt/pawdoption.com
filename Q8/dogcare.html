                <h2>Training</h2>
                <p>
                    Obedience training not only helps instill healthy doggy manners, but it also plays 
                    a big role in keeping your dog happy, healthy and safe. 
                    <br><br>
                    Dog training also helps provide mental and physical stimulation for your pup. 
                    Todd explains, “Training with positive reinforcement is also a fun enrichment 
                    activity for dogs and a way to engage their brain.” With positive reinforcement 
                    training, you'll praise and/or reward your pup with treats for performing the
                    desired cue. 
                    <br><br>
                    As a responsible pet parent, you should be including dog training in your daily 
                    routine. Whether it is making your dog sit before feeding them or having them 
                    wait for you to walk through doorways instead of allowing them to bolt through,
                    you can create habits that help keep your pup's manners sharp.

                <h2>Playtime</h2>
                <p>
                    Playtime is an essential part of building and strengthening the bond between
                    you and your pet. 
                    <br><br>
                    It allows you to establish a fun and positive relationship with your pet while 
                    also providing them with a productive outlet for their energy. As a responsible 
                    pet owner, you should set aside time to spend each day actively playing with
                    your pet. 
                    <br><br>
                    Dr. Jim Carlson,  DVM CVA CVTP, owner of Riverside Animal Clinic McHenry
                    and Grove Animal Hospital & Holistic Center in Chicago's Northwest Suburbs, says, 
                    “Dogs are companion animals so it's good for their mental well-being to have positive 
                    interaction with their human.”

                <h2>Daily Walks</h2>
                <p>
                    Dog walks are an important part of your dog's exercise and socialization routine.
                    As a responsible pet parent, you must have time to take your pup for daily walks.
                    <br><br>
                    Every dog needs regular walks—but how often and how long depends on the dog. There
                    are dogs that may only enjoy short walks to do their business and then want to head 
                    back inside, and there are other dogs that may need to go for longer runs to burn off
                    all their energy.
                    <br><br>
                    One thing to keep in mind when planning outdoor walks with your dog is the importance
                    of using a dog leash. It not only keeps your dog safe and under control, but it 
                    also allows other pet parents who may have reactive dogs or fearful dogs to walk their 
                    pups without worrying about your dog approaching without consent.
                    <br><br>
                    Off-leash time is important too.But you need to make sure that this off-leash time 
                    takes place in a secure and safe environment. Todd says that because leash rules are
                    different everywhere, you will need to find a place that is suitable and legal for your
                    dog to be running around.

                <h2>Cleaning Messes</h2>
                <p>
                    As a pet owner, you're responsible for your pet and the messes they make.
                    <br><br>
                    When you're walking your dog, always make sure to have dog poop bags on hand
                    to pick up any mess he leaves behind on the sidewalk or in a neighbor's lawn.
                    There are plenty of dog poop bag dispensers available that can be attached 
                    directly to your dog's leash, so there is no excuse to not pick up after your pup.
                    <br><br>
                    Picking up after your dog is an important pet parent responsibility because it
                    not only helps keep walkways clean, but it also prevents the spread of disease.
